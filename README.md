# Machine-Learning-Algorithms

This repository will explore the various alorithms used for machine learning.

## Inspiration
Inspiration to study the different machine learning algorithms in depth came from picking up a copy of "The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book" by Andriy Burkov. This book is a nice introduction into the world of machine learning algorithms, especially for someone who is self-taught and wants to work with data. Because it deals with algorithms, it is nice to have an understanding of mathematics and statistics when studying this as it will give one a richer understanding, however a background in math is not required if you're willing to learn as you read! 

## Data 
The datasets that I will be using in this 'study' of machine learning algorithms will all be comeing from Kaggle.com. Kaggle is a web-based platform that allows all data enthusiasts to come together to view, publish and explore datasets from others. Kaggle also hosts 'Kaggle Competitions' where people can practice working with data in a community-based sharing platform and get feedback on their work. 

Links to the individual datasets will be posted with the individual projects their conntected with.
